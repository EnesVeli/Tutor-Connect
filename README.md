## Strickly followed the MVC structure

You can login as a tutor. Create your profile select your subject that you teach, the days, your charge for that service, your years of experience (to show why the people who are being tutored to give you that money.), and your bio. You can view your schedule. In there it is shown to you the students name, their age and email, any messages thaat they left to you and the status, it is your choice to accept or decline the tutoring session.

Also you can login as a student set your profile, filter tutors based on your needs, find the one you want, select the date and "pay". and it will be on your schedule. I havent put up a fake link because 1) it wasnt mentioned in the project proposal 2) I tried and saw it looked bad

Finally you can login as an Admin see platform statistic; total users, platofrm earnings, total bookings, Active tutors and the most popular Tutors ordered by the top to lowest. Moreover you can manage users view, edit, delete. I didint add the option to add users because 1) wasnt mentioned in the project porpposal 2) there is no need because you can easily sign up at the start. Also you can delete the specific subject profile of a user. Lets say a tutor has 5 profiles where they teach different subjects. and in one of them in his bio he wrote a curse word, you can just edit or delete that subject.

Thats all i guess, have a nice day.
